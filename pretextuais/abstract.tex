	Converter control is being very exploited due to the numerous applications it has, among which is the generation of currents for grid injection. The connection of converters to the grid, however, presents several challenges such as parametric uncertainty associated to the plant and disturbances coming from the grid. Furthermore, inverters generate switching harmonics that need to be compensated. The tendency in control strategies is the relaxation of the classical requirement of complete knowledge of the plant, seeking robustness with respect to parametric uncertainties. This work presents a control strategy capable of disturbance rejection and good performance in relation to uncertainties, using Multi-Loop and Adaptive control techniques. Simulation results are presented, and experimental results demonstrate system operation.
