	Voltage-source converter control is being very exploited due to its numerous applications. Special attention is given to energy quality applications, which demand the injection of currents in the grid according to a reference current. The connection of converters to the grid, however, presents several challenges such as parametric uncertainty associated to the plant and disturbances coming from the grid. Furthermore, inverters generate switching harmonics that need to be filtered. The tendency in control strategies is the relaxation of the classical requirement of complete knowledge of the plant, seeking robustness with respect to parametric uncertainties. This work presents a control strategy capable of disturbance rejection and good performance in relation to uncertainties, using Multi-Loop and Adaptive control techniques. Simulation results are presented, and experimental results show the good behavior of the proposed system.
